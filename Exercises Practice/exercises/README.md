# Weekly Exercise Sets

 - They are to be done _individually_ and _independently_, though discussing _ideas_ with others is fine.  
   Reuse of code from others (including AI) is not.
 - There will be 6 exercise sets.
 - Momotor provides feedback and a score.
   - Aim for 100%. 
   - A set is _passed_ when the Momotor score is 80% or better.  
     80% corresponds (very roughly) to a barely passing grade at the final test (so: danger zone).
 - The best 5 of 6 count; i.e., one set can be "flunked".
 - Exercise sets are _deadlined_.  No retake is possible.  
   But exercise sets will be made available for later practicing (without credit), 
   in the assignment group _Test Yourself after Deadline_.
 - These exercise sets also help you prepare for the _Final Test_.
